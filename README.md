Prisma (for Dart) is a **next-generation ORM** for Dart and Flutter.

- **Most Popular Databases**: Prisma supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, SQLite, MongoDB and CockroachDB.
- **Type-safe**: Prisma Client is a query builder that’s tailored to your schema. We designed its API to be intuitive, both for SQL veterans and developers brand new to databases. The auto-completion helps you figure out your query without the need for documentation.
- **Human-readable**: Prisma schema is intuitive and lets you declare your database tables in a human-readable way — making your data modeling experience a delight. You define your models by hand or introspect them from an existing database.
